# FireFly-iii with Nginx on Ubuntu 20
This script will allow you to install Firefly-iii 5.6.5 (latest version when I did this) on Ubuntu 20.04 server with an Nginx reverse proxy and Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.

Make sure that your DNS settings are configured correctly prior to running this script, or else the Let's Encrypt SSL certificates won't load properly.
